# ðŸŒ³ Leaderboard Manager using Binary Search Tree (BST) in C

This project implements a **Leaderboard System** using a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in pure **C language**.  
Players are ranked based on their scores/ranks, and the leaderboard can be displayed in **sorted order** (in-order traversal) or as an **ASCII tree** structure!

> âœ… Supports dynamic insertion  
> âœ… Displays leaderboard in sorted order  
> âœ… Visualizes tree structure using ASCII art  
> âœ… Pre-built sample data for testing
