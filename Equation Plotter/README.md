# ðŸ“ˆ ASCII Graph Plotter (Postfix Expression Evaluator)

This project is a **Postfix Expression Graph Plotter** written in pure **C language**.  
It reads a math expression in **postfix (Reverse Polish Notation)**, evaluates it, and plots it as an ASCII graph right in the terminal!  

> âœ… Supports variable `x`  
> âœ… Plots graph from x = -20 to x = 20  
> âœ… Simple stack-based evaluator  
> âœ… Works in any terminal (Linux, Windows, macOS)

## ðŸš€ Features

- Supports basic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Handles numeric constants and variable `x`
- ASCII plotting grid from **x = -20 to 20** and **y = -10 to 10**
- Visualizes math functions like parabolas, lines, and more
