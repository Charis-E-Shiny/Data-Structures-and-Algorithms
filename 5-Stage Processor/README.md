# 🖥️ 5-Stage Pipeline Processor Simulation (C Language)

This repository contains a simple and clear simulation of a **5-stage instruction pipeline** using **C programming**. It demonstrates the working of Instruction Fetch (IF), Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB) stages — key concepts in computer architecture.

> ✅ Beginner-friendly code  
> ✅ No external libraries required  
> ✅ Clean stage-wise simulation with clock cycles

## 🚀 Pipeline Stages

This simulation follows the classic 5-stage pipeline:

| Stage | Full Form            |
|-------|----------------------|
| IF    | Instruction Fetch    |
| ID    | Instruction Decode   |
| EX    | Execute              |
| MEM   | Memory Access        |
| WB    | Write Back           |
