# DNA Linked List in C

This project demonstrates **linked list operations** using a simple **DNA sequence** concept.  
Each node in the linked list represents a **nucleotide** in the DNA strand.

## ðŸ§¬ About DNA

DNA (*Deoxyribonucleic Acid*) is the molecule that carries genetic information in living organisms.  
It is made up of a sequence of **nucleotides**, which are represented by four letters:

- **A** = Adenine
- **T** = Thymine
- **G** = Guanine
- **C** = Cytosine

In real DNA:
- Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T)
- Guanine (G) pairs with Cytosine (C)

In this project, we represent a **single DNA strand** where each nucleotide is stored in a **node** of a singly linked list.

## ðŸ”— How Linked List Matches DNA

- **Nodes** in linked lists are like **nucleotides** in DNA.
- **Next pointer** in each node is like the **phosphate backbone** that connects nucleotides together.
- We can **append**, **count**, **display**, and later even **search** or **delete** nucleotides â€” just like working with DNA sequences in bioinformatics!
