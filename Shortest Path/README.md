# 🚆 Railway Route Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm (C Language)

This project simulates a **Railway Network** where you can:
- Add stations 🏙️
- Connect them with distances (edges) 🚇
- Find the **shortest route** between stations using **Dijkstra's Algorithm** 🛤️

Written in **pure C language** using **adjacency lists** and **Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add new **stations**
- Add **edges** (routes with distance)
- Compute **shortest path** from selected station to all others using Dijkstra
- Handles up to **100 stations** (`MAX_STATIONS`)
